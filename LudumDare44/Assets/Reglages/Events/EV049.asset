    Message: "As Christmas approaches, the priest comes knocking on your door to ask
      for a contribution to the construction of the cr\xE8che. "
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You are getting tired of giving money to a cult you don't even believe
        in and that doesn't bring you anything. You donate the few coins in your pocket
        and go back to your business without delay.
      Response: Even if the amount is not large, the priest thanks you very sincerely
        for your help. Finally, you say to yourself that this institution is not as
        bad as you imagined. On the other hand, you can see that the construction
        of nurseries is not their strong suit.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You love Christmas and directly propose to build the crib with your
        own hands.
      Response: General, the priest explains that it is their pleasure to do the crib,
        and that they would prefer funds to help them. Despite everything, you choose
        to make a crib that will be better than theirs, and the whole village will
        traditionally begin to celebrate each year your rivalry with the church in
        terms of crib construction.
