    Message: A very influential family, and much richer than yours, sends you a letter
      proposing that you take a member of your family as a servant, in exchange for
      a large amount of gold.
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: You consider hiring assassins for a few seconds, then you remember that
        your finances are at their lowest. So you change your mind, and don't answer
        anything.
      Response: Noting your silence and cruelly wanting to have fun with your financial
        situation again, the family contacts you again to ask if you wanted to ask
        for alms. Shame covers you when you still can't do anything.
      effects:
      - Effect: 0
        EffectValue: -15
    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: In return, you answer them that you are making them exactly the same
        offer, with all the irony of the world. But you hope they won't accept, because
        you couldn't pay.
      Response: Your answer did not have any more at all to the family who first killed
        themselves for a few days, then recruited a pair of bandits to burn down your
        house. Some of it may have been saved, but you've rarely been so hurt.
