    Message: An old friend tells you that he wants to come and spend a holiday in
      your kingdom and asks for hospitality.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You ignore his request.
      Response: A few days later, you learn that this friend, in front of your silence,
        has chosen to spend his holidays a few leagues away, in the home of a rival
        family, which has not let his chance pass. You are sure that they will not
        fail to grumble at you.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You accept with pleasure, for the sake of the good old days.
      Response: After a few weeks, you start to wonder if he will ever leave, or if
        he has decided to be part of your family. One fine morning, you notice that
        he has simply left, but not without leaving a letter for you. He explains
        that he is actually a traveller and therefore has no point of landing. His
        travels have taken him to faraway countries, so he has been able to create
        a trade route to your city, and promises you spices and other wonders.
