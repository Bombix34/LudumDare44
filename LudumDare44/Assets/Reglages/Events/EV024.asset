    Message: 'As you pass the fortifications of the nearest town, you discover a scene
      of public execution. Your gaze is for a short while on the condemned person
      who cries out for injustice, then as you look more closely, you notice that
      this is an old acquaintance of yours, but not the most friendly. '
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: 'You intercept the executioner before he does his job, and use your
        influence to get him released. '
      Response: 'The executioner is not easily convinced, but when the prisoner is
        released, he recognizes you and thanks you on his knees. It offers you a fabulous
        family pendant because without you, it would have been recovered by the executioner. '

    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: You stay here and watch. Half hidden so he doesn't spot you in the crowd.
      Response: As he takes one last look at the crowd, he sees you and begs you to
        do something in the name of the "good old days" you may have spent together.
        When his head is sharply cut off, the crowd's eyes are on you. You're not
        very proud, but he got what he deserved.
