    Message: 'Your lord has summoned you to his immense castle. Once there, he makes
      you a proposal that deserves to be studied: he would like you to become his
      steward, and that you now reside at the castle. Of course, a very generous compensation
      would follow.'
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You accept the proposal, and abandon your role as head of the house
        for the good of the dynasty.
      Response: It's official, so you become the steward of one of the country's greatest
        lords. You proudly let your heir take your place at the head of the family.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You refuse, even if you thank him very much for offering you this. You
        are far too proud to be in charge of the dynasty.
      Response: The Lord is very clearly disappointed, and urges you to leave his
        castle. That said, he seemed to have a second choice, so he didn't hold it
        against you.
