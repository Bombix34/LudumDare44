    Message: 'You discover that $charactername is an integral part of the thieves''
      guild in its spare time. This information seemed obvious to you when you saw
      him leave at late hours at night, hooded, then return with his pockets full
      of gold before dawn. '
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You use $charactername to create a relationship between your family

      Response: 'First surprised, $charactername is quite happy to become an intermediary
        between your family and the guild. This promises a fruitful collaboration! '

      Choice: You blackmail $charactername to pay you a percentage of what he earns
