    Message: During an alcoholic evening in a bar to be raved about with a stranger,
      he invites you to his daughter's wedding the next day.
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: 'Completely drunk, you accept and go buy an expensive tiara to offer
        the bride. '
      Response: When you arrive at the ceremony, you realize that the unknown person
        in question is none other than the king of the neighbouring kingdom. The latter,
        delighted to see you keep your commitment, spends the day introducing you
        to his closest friends.

    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: You may be drunk, but you know the difference between a friend and a
        man out of nowhere. There's no way you're damaging your reputation by officially
        posting yourself with a stranger!
      Response: The next day, you learn that one of the continent's most prominent
        kings is marrying his daughter, and you decompose in front of your fireplace
        understanding the immense opportunity you have just missed.
