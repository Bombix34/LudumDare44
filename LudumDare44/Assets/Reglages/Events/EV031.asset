    Message: "You just learned that $charactername was kidnapped by bandits! These
      scoundrels are asking for a ransom of \"x\" \xE9cus! Such a sum cannot be taken
      lightly."
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: Pay the ransom with resentment.
      Response: At the time of paying the ransom, one of the blackmailers lets a sleeve
        of his garment stick out, revealing a crest belonging to a rival house. Once
        the transaction is completed, and the incident is over, you directly threaten
        this family to make them understand that you were not fooled.

        EffectValue: 20
    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: Pretend you didn't hear anything.
      Response: A few days later, your son returns alone to the family home. Realizing
        that you would never pay the ransom, the blackmailers preferred to avoid the
        embarrassment of committing a homicide.
