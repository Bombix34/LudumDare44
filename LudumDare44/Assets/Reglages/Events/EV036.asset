    Message: On a sunny day, you go to the garden of your country property. As you
      try to dig the ground, you notice a reinforcement in the nearest cliff that
      is also on your property. You hesitate to enter the cave.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: Take your courage with both hands, and plunge straight into the darkness.
      Response: A little disappointed, you don't find much wealth there. But there
        is still a huge cavity, miraculously illuminated by a tiny ray of sunlight
        filtering through the granite, and reflecting on the flowing walls. The scene
        is sublime, and of course you plan to make it profitable, by spreading the
        rumor of a curiosity on your territory.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: No one is there to judge you, you don't need to take such a risk. You
        then make a sign to forbid the entrance of the cave
      Response: The sign attracted the children from the nearby village who ventured
        there. One of them eventually slipped on the wet rocks some day, and the parents
        are now blaming you. You tell them they can only blame themselves, but your
        reputation still takes a serious hit.
