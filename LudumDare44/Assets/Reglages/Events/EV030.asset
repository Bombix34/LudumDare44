    Message: 'You notice that at the moment, your eldest and youngest children are
      very often in conflict. You don''t understand where this hatred comes from,
      but they seem to blame themselves more for their wrongs than if they were perfect
      rivals. '
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: You decide to conduct your investigation, perhaps by understanding the
        cause of their conflict, you could help them get along?
      Response: 'By looking around, you discover that everyone''s pattern was initiated
        by $charactername, your Benjamin. It doesn''t take you any longer to understand:
        This one was played off against each other for the sole purpose of becoming
        your heir. Seeing this, you deny it but manage to reconcile the other two.'

      - Effect: 2

    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: You propose that they settle this dispute the "old-fashioned way". You
        place them in a pen made of wood, explaining to them that whoever beat the
        other will be right. You hope that the fear of harm will win them over, so
        that they will understand the uselessness of such a family conflict.
      Response: You barely had time to close the enclosure when your two children
        are fighting fiercely, with violence that you can't really understand. Both
        will come out covered with injuries, which will certainly be noticed by those
        around you...
