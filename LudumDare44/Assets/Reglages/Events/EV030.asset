    Message: 'You notice that lately, your eldest and youngest children are very often
      in conflict. You don''t understand where this hatred comes from, but they seem
      to blame themselves more than real life ennemies. '
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You decide to conduct your investigation, perhaps by understanding the
        cause of their conflict, you could help them get along?
      Response: 'By looking around, you discover that everyone''s pattern was initiated
        by $charactername, your youngest heir. It doesn''t take you any longer to
        understand: $charactername was driving the two of them mad for the sole purpose
        of becoming your heir. Seeing this, you disown $charactername but manage to
        force the two other sons to make it up.'

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You propose that they settle this dispute the "old-fashioned way". You
        place them in a arena made of wood, explaining to them that whoever beat the
        other will be right. You hope that the fear of harm will win them over, so
        that they will understand the uselessness of such a family conflict.
      Response: You barely had time to close the enclosure that your two children
        are fighting fiercely, with violence that you can't really understand. Both
        will come out covered with injuries, which will certainly be noticed by those
        around you...
