    Message: On returning from a country walk, $charactername is proud to introduce
      its new pet, an adorable little rodent.
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: You pet the cute little animal and go back to your business.
      Response: You didn't pay attention and the rodent slipped into your office one
        day, and enjoyed some of your property titles. In an outburst of anger you
        crush the rodent with one vengeful foot. Since then, $charactername has been
        completely inconsolable.

    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: You ask him to take it back to where he found it, you wouldn't want
        to have allergies because of a pet.
      Response: $charactername shares his sadness with you, then he goes to the forest
        to let him resume his normal life. Not seeing him come back after a few hours,
        you will see where he may well be, and there, in a horror vision, you see
        that he is there, lying on the ground strewn with leaves, his body completely
        lacerated. He wasn't an arrow, but you would never have thought he could be
        murdered by a rodent...
