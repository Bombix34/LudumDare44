    Message: A very rich lord of a distant land meets your family, and immediately
      decides to unite your two dynasties by the sacred bonds of marriage. He offers
      you to marry $charactername. You barely know him, but while you are sitting
      at a table next to him, he makes you very subtly understand that if you accept,
      the reward will be up to the task.
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: Refuse! You are not going to exchange a family member for goods.
      Response: Outraged, the Lord declares that you will hear from him again. You
        then challenge him to a duel, and as his expression seems to break down, he
        announces in a voice that is not very confident that he is not trained enough
        to take up the challenge.

    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: Immediately exchange a cup of ale with them to celebrate the upcoming
        wedding! The ambition to become an aristocrat makes you wander a little while
        while you take a sip.
      Response: 'A few days later, a messenger announces to you a delegation from
        the Lord, and you leave your home, imagining wonderful riches. As you leave,
        you let out a scream of surprise and disgust: The gift happens to be half
        a dozen delicately placed camels in your stable.'
