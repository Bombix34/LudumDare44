    Message: 'Your lord has summoned you to his immense castle. Once there, he makes
      you a proposal that deserves to be studied: he would like you to become his
      steward, and that you now reside at his castle. Of course, a very generous compensation
      would follow.'
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You accept the proposal, and abandon your role as head of the house
        for the good of the dynasty.
      Response: Once you are in place at your post, you understand the deception.
        The castle is in a sorry state, and restoring it requires more than considerable
        work. Finally, your reputation is damaged because all the lord's problems
        are reported on your back.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You refuse, even if you thank him very much for offering you this. You
        are far too proud to be in charge of the dynasty to leave it.
      Response: You have learned that whoever replaced you very quickly collapsed
        under work. At the castle, everyone repeats in a low voice that you probably
        would have done a much better job.
