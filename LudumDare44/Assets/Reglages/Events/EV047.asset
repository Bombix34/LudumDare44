    Message: During your weekly crowd request session, a ten-year-old child approaches
      you and declares in front of everyone that he is the fruit of an adventure you
      supposedly had with a former servant of your family.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You pretend not to know this person and declare publicly that you are
        more loyal than anyone else.
      Response: Just after, his mother calls you and swears that you gave birth to
        him 9 years ago, during a particularly harsh winter. This anecdote reminds
        all those who know you that at that time you were travelling on behalf of
        your king. She then makes a fool of herself, while you judge her condescendingly.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You publicly acknowledge your youthful mistakes and make a generous
        donation to allow your illegitimate child to live with dignity.
      Response: A few months later, you discover a birthmark on your "child"'s back
        that proves you are not related to her. So you were taken for a fool, but
        it's too late to declare the opposite...
