    Message: While walking around the village market, you observe a beggar prowling
      around, looking sick. You don't have time to duck him and let him throw himself
      at you to beg for money. You push it away with a blow of the cuff, but when
      you try to hold on to something, it scratches you quite deeply.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 4
      Choice: 'You go home, disgusted, and do what is necessary by contacting your
        family to punish the beggar. '
      Response: You manage to have the beggar executed in public. But a few weeks
        later, you notice that part of the family has some of the symptoms of the
        plague. You won't last very long in this condition.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: No one is there to judge you, you don't need to take such a risk.
      Response: You go home, take a scroll large enough, and write in capital letter
        "DO NOT ENTER", to stick it on the entrance of the cave.
