    Message: You just learned that $charactername was kidnapped by bandits! These
      scoundrels are asking for a ransom of "x" gold coins ! Such an amount of money
      cannot be taken lightly.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: Pay the ransom with regrets.
      Response: Without delay, you contacted the bandits and begged them to give you
        your child back. They kept their end of the bargain while laughing at you
        and your weakness of mind.

    ProposalTwo:

      Choice: Pretend you didn't hear anything.
      Response: Your advisor remains nailed in place, while you order him to keep
