    Message: You are hosting a very wealthy foreign national and his entire family
      who are travelling. A few hours before they leave, $charactername explains that
      he will go with them to their country so that he can live a love that does not
      care about sexual orientation.
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: You accept, you only want his good, and he would have been unhappy anyway
        by staying here.
      Response: More than surprised, he thanks you warmly, and promises you that he
        will make your name ring out abroad.

    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: Refuse, you need it to keep your family going and the common interest

        accepts his sad destiny.
