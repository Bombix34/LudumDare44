    Message: One fine morning, $charactername comes to you to share with you his desire
      to join the national war, to cover your house with glory.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You let him know that you are very proud, and that you totally approve
        of him! You give him enough money so that he can make the trip and buy himself
        armor.
      Response: After more than two years, you still haven't seen $charactername again.
        You are convinced that he is now dead and buried and that no one has ever
        heard of your family. However, a few days later, you receive a letter telling
        you that $charactername was adoubated at the royal court. It still proudly
        bears your name, and covers you with more glory than you could have imagined.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You refuse to let him abandon his family and pretend that you need him
        for domestic tasks.
      Response: $charactername then offers you an agreed solution, he would be trained
        in weapons, but would stay to protect your family, thus covering your family's
        glory to a much lesser extent.
