    Message: 'One evening, as you enter your room, a sharp pain runs through your
      heart. Before you can do anything, you find yourself on the ground, unable to
      breathe with regularity. '
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You scream out for help for your life, crying, and screaming at death.
      Response: A few hours later, you wake up shaking on your bed. You will later
        learn that you vomited and defecated multiple times on the doctor in your
        delirium, and that the doctor asked for an increase in his fees as a result.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You hope someone will pass through there soon, because it's unlikely
        you'll be alive in an hour.
      Response: Luckily, a member of your family passed by your room, and he found
        you bent over backwards as you tried to remain silent. He absolutely did not
        understand why you wanted to hide while you were dying, and could not save
        you in time.
