    Message: '$charactername begs you to listen to his request: He is only your 4th
      child, and he knows full well that he has little chance of becoming the main
      heir. He subtly insists that you understand that he would like financial compensation,
      so that he can still secure his future.'
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: Tell him that times are hard, and that a black plague is coming so quickly.
        He will not have a bronze piece, but you still recognize that he had the audacity
        to ask for it.
      Response: With a little smile on his face, he says he suspected your answer.
        He approaches you and whispers very clear threats, involving the death of
        your other sons. He is truly convincing, and when in doubt, you prefer to
        ensure that nothing will happen by paying him a small nest egg.
      effects:
      - Effect: 1
        EffectValue: -500
    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: Give him a small nest egg so he can feel like a winner, but not enough
        to escape your influence.
      Response: He takes the gold with a big smile and thanks you very much. A little
        less than two years later, you discover that he has made his money grow in
        ways that are probably not very good, and that he has taken advantage of it
        to get out of your influence anyway. You deny it, but it is already a little
        late, your family has learned how much you have been harmed.
