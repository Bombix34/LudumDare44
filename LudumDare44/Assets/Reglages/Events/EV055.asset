    Message: You have been hearing rumours for some time now that two members of your
      family are close. Maybe even too close.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You summon them to get to the bottom of it.
      Response: While you were thinking about the worst, they reveal to you that they
        both took a passion for politics. They were both working hard to get some
        high placed work at the closest castle in order to impose their vision to
        the world. You take this opportunity to tell them to do so on your behalf,
        so that they can strengthen your reputation.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You don't take care of them, after all, they don't hurt anyone.
      Response: A few weeks later, you learn that your two relative ones are both
        leaving to become advisors to a close lord. They seem determined to gain political
        power, and you almost regret not helping them to be part of the project.
