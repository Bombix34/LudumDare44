    Message: 'You are a candidate to lead the merchant guild, but the matriarch of
      a large rival family seems to be much more favorite than you. You cannot let
      it take such an economic lead over you, at the risk of falling far behind. '
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You know one of the current members of the guild very well and you are
        complicit enough with him to be able to plan a plan to discredit the said
        matriarch.
      Response: The plan only worked halfway, and the discord created divisions within
        the guild. You have been chosen, but this one is not in its best form.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You use your influence to bring a large number of foreign merchants

      Response: Not only have you taken control of the guild, but thanks to these
        trade routes, you are in an excellent position.
