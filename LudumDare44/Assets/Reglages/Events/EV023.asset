    Message: 'You are a candidate to lead the merchant guild, but the matriarch of
      a large rival family seems to be much more favorite than you. You cannot let
      her take such an economic lead over you, at the risk of falling far behind in
      terms of money. '
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You know one of the current members of the guild very well and you are
        friends enough to be able to plan something to discredit the matriarch.
      Response: The plan only worked halfway, and the discord created divisions within
        the guild. You have been chosen, but you've seen the merchant guild in better
        shape.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You use your influence to bring a large number of foreign merchants
        into the city to create potential new trade routes.
      Response: Not only have you taken control of the guild, but thanks to these
        trade routes, you are in an excellent position of power.
