    Message: 'As you pass the fortifications of the nearest town, you discover a scene
      of public execution. Your gaze is for a short while on the condemned person
      who cries out for injustice, then as you look more closely, you notice that
      this is an old acquaintance of yours, but not the most friendly. '
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 7
      Choice: 'You intercept the executioner before he does his job, and use your
        influence to get him released. '
      Response: The executioner seems determined not to listen to you, and hastens
        to finish the work he started. It allows you to step up to the podium to make
        a wonderful plea for global justice and the inhuman treatment that some people
        must endure, a speech that will make him talk about it in the future.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 7
      Choice: You stay here and watch. Half hidden so he doesn't spot you in the crowd.
      Response: He then sees you as he looks subtly at the crowd. He seems to want
        to ask you for help, then change his mind. He probably remembered all the
        bad times he had with you. It's certainly a horrible way to die...
