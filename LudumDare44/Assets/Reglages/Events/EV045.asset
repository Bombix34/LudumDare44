      Choice: 'With the help of alcohol, you promise him all the wonders for his daughter.
        You are comfortable with money right now, and you are as happy as he is. '
      Response: As you began to regret your decision the day before at the altar of
        the stranger's daughter, the latter, more than touched by your gesture, announces
        to everyone that his family to come, and his wealth will now be your vassals,
        and you recognize him as such.

      Choice: You may be drunk, but you know the difference between a friend and a
        man out of nowhere. There's no way you're damaging your reputation by officially
        posting yourself with a stranger!
      Response: Upset of such a turn of events, the stranger insults you copiously,
        and you return the favor. The scene is not particularly beautiful to see,
        and hearing it told by outsiders is all the more shameful.
