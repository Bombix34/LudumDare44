    Message: During a Sunday meal, one of your closest friends begins to get angry
      with your family members, accusing you of enjoying his wealth and threatening
      to declare an open war on you.
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: You decide to discreetly poison his drink as soon as the rest of the
        guests no longer pay attention to you.
      Response: Your "friend" is found cold by servants a few hours later on the toilet.
        Rumours of his death are spreading around and your altercation accuses you
        as much as it does of a true confession.

        EffectValue: -15
    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: You in turn get angry at this heinous defamation and ask him to leave
        your home.
      Response: The following night, a gang of mercenaries broke into the castle,
        and managed to murder a large part of your family before being killed by the
        guard.
