    Message: $charactername is talking to you at length to let you know about a difficult
      decision. He chose to abandon the couple's life that the dynasty imposed on
      him and to leave with a commoner for love.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: Prevent him from leaving the room, and accuse him loud and clear of
        a fact that he did not commit so that your henchmen can hear the scene from
        the outside.
      Response: Panicked, and totally terrified, $charactername knelt in front of
        him, and begged you to spare him. He admits that finally this love is not
        so strong after all, and promises that he will abandon any idea of leaving.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: Tell him that you understand, but have no choice but to deny him and
        exclude him from the family.
      Response: He suddenly seems much paler. He had not considered this possibility
        at all. However, he is completely trapped, and for a few days, he leaves on
        his own, not without crying.
