    Message: While walking around the village market, you observe a beggar prowling
      around, looking sick. You don't have time to duck him and let him throw himself
      at you to beg for money. You push it away with a blow of the cuff, but when
      you try to hold on to something, it scratches you quite deeply.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: 'You go home, disgusted, and do what is necessary by contacting your
        family to punish the beggar. '
      Response: All those who were in contact with you after this event became seriously
        ill and eventually healed. A long time later, it was found that none of these
        people became ill, in any case. Probably witchcraft...

    ProposalTwo:

      Choice: You take your annual bath much earlier than expected, and rinse your
        body thoroughly with hot water.
      Response: Several days later, you are still infected, and it is very painful
        for you. You call the family doctor Doctis Imo who diagnoses you with a plague
        and extorts a large amount of gold from you.
