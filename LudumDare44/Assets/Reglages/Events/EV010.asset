    Message: As you enter a room in the family estate, you surprise $charactername
      with gay sex. Horrified, the two lovers dare not say a word.
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: With a very pronounced expression of disgust, you pretend to faint in
        the face of the shock, while the two interested begin to consider running
        away. You then prevent them from doing so by standing in front of the exit,
        and shouting insults at them.
      Response: The screams stirred up the passers-by, who didn't need a drawing to
        understand what had happened.
      effects:
      - Effect: 0
        EffectValue: -15
    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: You immediately close the door, and walk away. Nothing happened at all.
      Response: Less than a week later, the scandal broke while everyone was at the
        table, and in self-defense, $charactername did not hesitate to remind you
        that you were there and that you did not look more shocked than that at the
        time.
