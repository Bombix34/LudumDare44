    Message: Less than a week later, the scandal broke while everyone was at the table,
      and in self-defense, $charactername did not hesitate to remind you that you
      were there and that you did not look more shocked than that at the time.
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: You let him know that you are very proud, and that you totally approve
        of him! You give him enough money so that he can make the trip and buy himself
        armor.
      Response: A year later, $charactername will return preceded by its reputation.
        He then tells a thousand stories that would almost make you wish you hadn't
        joined him.

    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: You refuse to let him abandon his family and pretend that you need him
        for domestic tasks.
      Response: He protests, furious and swears that he has nothing left to do in
        this family. He will eventually leave, never to hear from him again.
