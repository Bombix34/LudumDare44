    Message: You receive a letter from a prominent family in a nearby town, who proposes
      to organize a banquet.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: 'You agree to participate, and order your servants to prepare the speciality
        of your house: "La tourte aux champignons".'
      Response: Once there, you realize that this banquet was actually just a way
        to make a fool out of you by being rude to your family all along the party.
        You can't stand these mockery for long, and go home absolutely furious.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You refuse! There is no way you can be seen at a party as rudimentary
        as theirs, and you send them a letter to make them understand that it is useless
        to invite you again.
      Response: In the days to come, rumours will spread, and the notable family will
        be mocked for the answer you gave to them.
