    Conditions: []
    Message: You receive a letter from a prominent family in a nearby town, who proposes
      to organize a banquet.
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: 'You agree to participate, and order your servants to prepare the speciality
        of your house: Mushroom Pie.'
      Response: Once there, you realize that this banquet was actually just a way
        to make a fool of yourself by being rude to you all along the party. You can't
        stand these mockery for long, and go home absolutely furious.
      effects:
      - Effect: 0
        EffectValue: -15
    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: You refuse! There is no way you can be seen at a party as rudimentary
        as theirs, and you send them a letter to make them understand that it is useless
        to invite you back.
      Response: In the days to come, rumours will spread that the notable family has
        been ridiculed by you.
