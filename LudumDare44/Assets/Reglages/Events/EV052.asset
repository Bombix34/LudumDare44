    Message: 'You are a candidate to lead the merchant guild, but the matriarch of
      a large rival family seems to be much more favorite than you. You cannot let
      it take such an economic lead over you, at the risk of falling far behind. '
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: You know one of the current members of the guild very well and you are
        close enough to him to be able to plan a plan to discredit the said matriarch.
      Response: Behind your back, the matriarch has doubled you, paying your guild
        member friend big time. You have made a bit of a fool of yourself in your
        approach, and you have missed a great opportunity to become a guild master.
      effects:
      - Effect: 0
        EffectValue: -10
    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: You use your influence to bring a large number of foreign merchants
        into the city to create potential new trade routes.
      Response: The matriarch was far too far ahead of you anyway, you were not chosen.
        However, being the guarantor of all these new trade routes, you make sure
        you have a certain amount of money that satisfies you a little.
