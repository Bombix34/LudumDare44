    Message: You just married your first child, you couldn't be happier. Well actually
      you could since you understood that the other family only did this out of pure
      thirst of influence. At least you had gold for it. You then realise that if
      you had a child of the other gender, the roles would have been switched. Furthermore
      this would have meant no heirs.

      Choice: You thank god it didn't happen.
      Response: Less than 6 months later, you can see that the newly wed couple didn't
        waste time. Your grand child is going to be the first of many more to come
