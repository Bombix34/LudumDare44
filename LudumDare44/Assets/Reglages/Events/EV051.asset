    Message: During a Sunday meal, one of your closest friends begins to get angry
      with your family members, accusing you of enjoying his wealth and threatening
      to declare an open war on you.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 9
      Choice: You decide to discreetly poison his drink as soon as the rest of the
        guests no longer pay attention to you.
      Response: You didn't expect such a quick effect, but even before the meal is
        over, your friend is holding his throat with full hands, and seems to be choking,
        even though you know that the reason is quite different. Your alibi is absolutely
        perfect, and his death seems to be a divine punishment in the eyes of others.
      effects:
      - Effect: 0
        EffectValue: 10
    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You in turn get angry at this heinous defamation and ask him to leave
        your home.
      Response: In the days that follow, your health worsens, and if at first you
        blame it on food, you realize at some point that you have been poisoned. You
        will later die in excruciating suffering, under the dazed eyes of your family.
