    Message: At a mass in which you participate as a family, a priest comes to see
      you, and insists that $charactername should join the church, given his interest
      in religion.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You are looking forward to build a strong relationship with the church,
        and explain to $charactername that he will take the clothe.
      Response: A few weeks later, you discover from $charactername's mouth that the
        priest has more than once had inappropriate behaviour. Horrified, you change
        your mind and immediately call $charactername back to your home.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You explain to the priest that you will think about it, and then avoid
        eye contact every time you meet him.
      Response: A few weeks later you hear more than disturbing rumours about the
        priest, and you occasionally tell how you felt the danger was coming and that's
        why you refused his offer. Your intuition seems to impress many people.
