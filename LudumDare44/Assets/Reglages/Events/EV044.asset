    Message: You receive a letter from a prominent family in a nearby town, who proposes
      to organize a banquet.
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: 'You agree to participate, and order your servants to prepare your house''s
        specialty: Mushroom Pie.'
      Response: You didn't think you were having such a good time, while everyone
        is enjoying your pie. You return home covered with a glory you didn't even
        know existed.

        EffectValue: 10
    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: You refuse! There is no way you can be seen at a party as rudimentary
        as theirs, and you send them a letter to make them understand that it is useless
        to invite you back.
      Response: In the general misunderstanding, you are told that there are no worries,
        and that it was a simple proposal. In the days to come, you will be laughed
        at somewhat, parodying your exaggerated reaction.
