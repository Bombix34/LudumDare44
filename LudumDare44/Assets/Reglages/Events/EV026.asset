    Message: You have been hearing rumours for some time now that two members of your
      family are close. Maybe even too close.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You summon them to get to the bottom of it.
      Response: Against all odds, they choose to claim their act, and seem to have
        taken their courage in both hands to tell you that they love each other to
        the end. In front of this statement, you have no choice but to deny them from
        your family, even if you have little against them.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You don't take care of them, after all, they don't hurt anyone.
      Response: A few weeks later, a scandal broke when a villager declared that he
        had seen the two forbidden lovers fornicating through one of the house's windows.
        Your reputation is damaged, but you must stand up for them, now.
