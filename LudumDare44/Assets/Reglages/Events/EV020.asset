    Message: "As Christmas approaches, the priest comes knocking on your door to ask
      for a contribution to the construction of the cr\xE8che. "
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You are getting tired of giving money to a cult you don't even believe
        in and that doesn't bring you anything. You donate the few coins in your pocket
        and go back to your business without delay.
      Response: Disappointed, the priest left with your meagre gift and echoed your
        stininess throughout the village. You are now becoming the role model not
        to be repeated and you are unwillingly encouraging all the nobbies around
        you to give nice sums of money.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You love Christmas and directly propose to build the crib with your
        own hands.
      Response: To really participate in the construction makes you earn the respect
        and admiration of the little people. Besides, it was free.
