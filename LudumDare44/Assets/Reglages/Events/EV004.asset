    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You ignore his request.
      Response: Someday, you just meet him not far from your house, and you have no
        choice but to talk to him. Vexed, he asks you why you never answered his letter.
        You stammer an excuse about a lost carrier pigeon to get rid of him.
