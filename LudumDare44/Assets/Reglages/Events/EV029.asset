    Message: '$charactername begs you to listen to his request: He is only your 4th
      child, and he knows full well that he has little chance of becoming the main
      heir. He subtly insists that you understand that he would like financial compensation,
      so that he can still secure his future.'
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: Tell him that times are hard, and that a black plague is coming so quickly.
        He will not have a bronze piece, but you still recognize that he had the audacity
        to ask for it.
      Response: Furious, he castigates you while you make fun of him. A few days later,
        he decided to leave the house because he felt that there was no point in staying
        there. You deny it to compensate for this affront.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: Give him a small nest egg so he can feel like a winner, but not enough
        to escape your influence.
      Response: He thanks you with a cheerful look. To his expression as he walks
        out the door, you understand that he may again meet his needs in this way...
