    Message: A very rich lord of a distant land meets your family, and immediately
      decides to unite your two dynasties by the sacred bonds of marriage. He offers
      you to marry $charactername. You barely know him, but while you are sitting
      at a table next to him, he makes you very subtly understand that if you accept,
      the reward will be up to the task.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: Refuse! You are not going to exchange a family member for goods.
      Response: Outraged, the Lord declares that you will hear from him again. You
        then challenge him to a duel, and to your surprise, he accepts! He is actually
        a great swordsman, and he kills you so fast that your family doesn't even
        have time to be surprised...

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: Immediately exchange a cup of ale with them to celebrate the upcoming
        wedding! The ambition to possess some property at the end of the world makes
        you fantasize a little while while you take a sip of your cup.
      Response: A few days later, a messenger announces a delegation from the Lord.
        He is in fact a formidable warlord. You understand this when you find yourself
        in front of whole crates of weapons of all kinds. The weapons won't be helpful
        for now, but the rumour will spread that one would have to think twice before
        insulting you from now on.
