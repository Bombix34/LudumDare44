    Message: You are hosting a very wealthy foreign national and his entire family
      who are travelling. A few hours before they leave, $charactername explains that
      he will go with them to their country so that he can live a love that does not
      care about sexual orientation.

        arts, and to live from day to day.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 9
      Choice: Refuse, you need it to keep your family going and the common interest
        must come first.
      Response: You haven't taken his love seriously enough, he cries, shouts, tells

        death by ingesting a deadly poison a few days later.
