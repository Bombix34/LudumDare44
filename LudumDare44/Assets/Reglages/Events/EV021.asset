    Message: A very influential family, and much richer than yours, sends you a letter
      proposing that you take a member of your family as a servant, in exchange for
      a large amount of gold.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You consider hiring assassins for a few seconds, then you remember that
        your finances are at their lowest. So you change your mind, and don't answer
        anything.
      Response: A few days later, you hear villagers whispering as they tell this
        story with a lot of fun. You take it upon yourself not to get angry.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: In return, you answer them that you are making them exactly the same
        offer, with all the irony of the world. But you hope they won't accept, because
        you couldn't pay.
      Response: The answer to your provocation is not long in coming, and this time
        the letter is much more threatening.
