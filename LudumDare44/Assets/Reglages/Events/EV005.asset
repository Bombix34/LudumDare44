    Message: As you go out one night in the village, a group of young people at the
      door of a dark house call out to you. They insist heavily that you join them
      inside to spend the evening with them. On closer inspection, many of them are
      partially naked.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: 'Accept, no one will ever know, and you really need to "relax". '
      Response: You wake up the next day, in the middle of tangled bodies. You discreetly
        leave the house and go home without saying anything to your half, with a shared
        feeling.
      effects: []
    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: 'Refuse, you are not on that side, and you will not succumb to temptation
        today. '
      Response: 'You are then booed and pursued in the middle of the street by a dozen
        drunk and naked people. This wakes up the neighbourhood, which misinterprets
        this ridiculous scene. '
