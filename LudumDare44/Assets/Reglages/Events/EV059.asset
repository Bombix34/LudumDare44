    Message: 'You notice that lately, your eldest and youngest children are very often
      in conflict. You don''t understand where this hatred comes from, but they seem
      to blame themselves more than real life ennemies. '
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 1
      Choice: You decide to conduct your investigation, perhaps by understanding the
        cause of their conflict, you could help them get along?
      Response: Despite your research, you are unable to understand the reasons for
        their conflicts. One fine morning you discover the body of your elder, your
        heir lying in your property. Your youngest child then breaks down in tears
        explaining that he did not want to do so, but that $charactername, your youngest
        child, clearly suggested that he should do so. You then disown $charactername
        for his crime, but cannot bring yourself to execute him. You don't understand
        where all this hatred came from.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 7
      Choice: You propose that they settle this dispute the "old-fashioned way". You
        place them in a arena made of wood, explaining to them that whoever beat the
        other will be right. You hope that the fear of harm will win them over, so
        that they will understand the uselessness of such a family conflict.
      Response: It was probably the worst idea you've ever had in your life, you can't
        stop your two children and they kill each other in an incomprehensible bloodbath.
