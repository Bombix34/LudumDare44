    Message: 'You notice that at the moment, your eldest and youngest children are
      very often in conflict. You don''t understand where this hatred comes from,
      but they seem to blame themselves more for their wrongs than if they were perfect
      rivals. '
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: You decide to conduct your investigation, perhaps by understanding the
        cause of their conflict, you could help them get along?
      Response: Despite your research, you are unable to understand the reasons for
        their conflicts. One fine morning you discover the body of your elder, your
        heir lying in your property. Your youngest child then breaks down in tears
        explaining that he did not want to do so, but that $charactername, your youngest
        child, clearly suggested that he should do so. You then deny $charactername
        for his crime, but cannot bring yourself to execute him. You don't understand
        where all this hatred came from.

    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: You ask him to take it back to where he found it, you wouldn't want
        to have allergies because of a pet.
      Response: $charactername insists and then, in front of your impassivity, sadly
        returns to give his new friend his freedom.
