    Message: As you enter a room in the family estate, you surprise $charactername
      with gay sex. Horrified, the two lovers did not dare to say a word.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: With a very pronounced expression of disgust, you pretend to faint in
        the face of the shock, while the two interested begin to consider running
        away. You then prevent them from doing so by standing in front of the exit,
        and shouting insults at them.
      Response: In a gesture of panic, one of them grabs a broken shard of mud in
        the hate, and slits your throat in a single gesture. You bleed to death very
        quickly, taking your secret to the grave.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You immediately close the door, and walk away. Nothing happened at all.
      Response: The next day, the two lovers come to you to tell you how serious their
        love is, and that they have made the decision to assume their choice of sexuality
        in front of the whole family. You try to dissuade them at all costs, but $charactername
        will still make its announcement later in the evening. Shame covers you while
        you almost regret your choice of tolerance.
