    Message: $charactername is talking to you at length to let you know about a difficult
      decision. He chose to abandon the couple's life that the dynasty imposed on
      him and to leave with a commoner for love.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 1
      Choice: Prevent him from leaving the room, and accuse him loud and clear of
        a fact that he did not commit so that your henchmen can hear the scene from
        the outside.
      Response: A few days later, the news came to inform the family that $charactername
        had been brutally murdered in an alleyway, but that the cause of such an incident
        was incomprehensible.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: Tell them that you understand, but have no choice but to deny them and
        exclude them from the family.
      Response: As the family learns of the choice you have made, many of them openly
        criticize you by not hesitating to claim that with them, it would have been
        otherwise.
