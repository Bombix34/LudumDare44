    Message: After years in the shadow of his elder brother, $charactername succumbs
      to his sick jealousy. You find your child above your heir's mutilated corpse,
      with a knife in hand.
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: You scream in pain at the sight of the flesh of your inert flesh before
        you, and you have the traitor arrested by your personal guard.
      Response: Suddenly, something changes in the look of $charactername, you've
        never seen him so disturbed before. At the moment the guards came to control
        him, he moved like a snake in the room and managed to assassinate the two
        guards without any difficulty. He then disappears into the shadow of the night.

    ProposalTwo:
      CustomSongId: 7
      Choice: Devastated by the loss of a child, you decide to forgive him so you
        do not to lose a second one. You're spreading rumors about the elder's strange
        disappearance to cover up the murder.
      Response: You thought it was just fraternal jealousy, but it seems that $charactername
        is driven by a completely different motive. He doesn't even seem really interested
        in the heir responsibility, and his head is always elsewhere, even when you
        talk to him. A little more than a year after the event, another member of
        your family dies, bleeding while sleeping. You can't prove it, but you're
        sure it is actually $charactername...
