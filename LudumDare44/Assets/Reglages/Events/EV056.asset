    Message: 'You discover that $charactername is an integral part of the thieves''
      guild in its spare time. This information seemed obvious to you when you saw
      him leave at late hours at night, hooded, then return with his pockets full
      of gold before dawn. '
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: You use $charactername to create a relationship between your family
        and the Thief Guild. This will ensure that you do not suffer a burglary and
        you may even expect lucrative business.
      Response: Rather reluctant to see his family universe mix with his secret universe,
        $charactername categorically refuses. You are obviously not up to the task.
      effects:
      - Effect: 0
        EffectValue: -10
    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: You blackmail $charactername to pay you a percentage of what he earns
        every time he goes on a night expedition.
      Response: He seems almost insulted, and does not hesitate for a second to do
        the same for you. If you ask him for gold again, he will give you up to custody
        by showing them clear evidence that you are actually the thief. You're very
        embarrassed and so forget about this story.
