    Message: It's been several weeks since you broke your leg. Tonight, for the first
      time, you plan to start your rehabilitation by walking to the tavern. The expedition
      is more ambitious than expected, and you arrive at the tavern early in the evening.
      So you take the opportunity to drink a cervoise, and it is then that a traveller
      in a strange outfit invites you to share his evening with you.
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: You accept, you tell yourself that it could help you return to your
        property in case of a problem.
      Response: 'After hours of drinking, eating and laughing at the world around
        you, the traveller offers to help you return home. On the way, the traveller
        stops, and when you ask him why, he explains that he actually came to murder
        you. Everyone will think you had a simple accident on the road. '
