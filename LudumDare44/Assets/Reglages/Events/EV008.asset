      Choice: Devastated by the loss of a child, you decide to forgive him so as not
        to lose a second one. You're spreading rumors about the elder's strange disappearance
        to cover up the murder.

        the people are not fooled and everyone is beginning to think that you are
        irresponsible for letting a dangerous madman go free.
