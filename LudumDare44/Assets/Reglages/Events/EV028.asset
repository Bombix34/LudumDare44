    Message: It's been several weeks since you broke your leg. Tonight, for the first
      time, you plan to start your rehabilitation by walking to the tavern. The expedition
      is more ambitious than expected, and you arrive at the tavern early in the evening.
      So you take the opportunity to drink a cervoise, and it is then that a traveller
      in a strange outfit invites you to share his evening with you.
    ProposalOne:
      Choice: You accept, you tell yourself that it could help you return to your
        property in case of a problem.
      Response: This was your very last memory of the evening. You woke up two days
        later in bed, being able to walk without any pain, as if your foot had never
        been broken. In living memory, this is probably the strangest evening you
        have ever experienced.
      effects:
      - Effect: 0
        EffectValue: 10
    ProposalTwo:
      Choice: You refuse, leave drunk means a risk of injury again and you need to
        be on your feet as soon as possible.
      Response: Your rehabilitation will ultimately be much slower than expected,
        and the doctor's fees far exceed your expectations.
