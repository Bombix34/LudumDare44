    Message: 'You learn from a villager that $charactername has been insulted by a
      loser thirsty man many times. '
    ProposalOne:
      CustomSongId: 0
      Choice: 'You organize yourself to have the culprit caught by your men, and make
        him fully available to $charactername. '
      Response: At the discretion of $charactername, you let him talk to himself alone.
        You'll never know how he did it, but $charactername now became adored by a
        large part of the villagers.

    ProposalTwo:

      Choice: You ignore the remark, he's just a peasant.
      Response: $charactername later learned of the affront made against him, and
        while you feared an unnecessary vendetta, he offered him a full purse to the
        drunk so that he could get out of begging. You have lost money, but it seems
        that $charactername is now considered the greatest representative of justice
        in the area.
